# 🧠 Prolog Foundations — Logic Programming Exercises with Models of Computation

> A structured collection of Prolog exercises developed as preparation for building a rule-based intelligent agent.

This repository contains a progressive set of Prolog problems focused on **logical inference, symbolic reasoning, and declarative problem-solving** through **implementing different models of computation**. The goal is to build a strong foundation in logic programming before implementing a full **Prolog-based agent system**.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Develop fluency in declarative programming with Prolog  
- Practice reasoning with facts, rules, and queries  
- Understand unification, backtracking, and resolution  
- Model symbolic knowledge and constraints  
- Prepare for agent-based logical inference systems

---

## 🛠 Topics Covered

- Facts and rules  
- Unification and pattern matching  
- Recursion and termination  
- List processing  
- Logical relations  
- Backtracking and search  
- Constraint-style reasoning

---

## 🚀 Goal

The long-term goal of this repository is to evolve into a **lightweight Prolog-based agent** that can:

- reason over a symbolic knowledge base  
- apply logical rules for decision-making  
- and demonstrate explainable inference
